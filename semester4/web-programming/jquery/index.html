<!-- Write a web page which displays in the middle of the browser window a horizontal slider containing a list of images. The slider should continuously 
 slide from the left to the right side of the browser window. Each image that exits the browser window on the right side should enter the browser window 
 on the left side. The sliding should be animated. If the user clicks on an image, the sliding is paused and a larger version of that window pops in the 
 center of the browser window (just like images appear in the Lightbox javascript library). If the user clicks anywhere on this large image, the image 
 dissapears and the sliding of the horizontal image bar is resumed. -->
